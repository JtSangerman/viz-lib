# viz-lib
Lightweight library containing visual and harmonic renderings (via d3.js) that aim to depict beauty in natural processes, patterns and algorithms alike. Easily add stimulating visual and harmonic elements to your web app. 

This repo contains library source code and a simple angular web app for demo and documentation of library components available:
* Demo app source located at `src/demo-app`
* Lib source located at `src/lib`

3. `npm i`
4. `ng serve`

---------------------------------

Marcus and I are using this project as an outlet for exploring our interest in using visuals and/or harmoics to create renderings to depict beauty within data sets, algorithms, natural processes, natural patterns... or something. dunno yet! 

<sub><sub>i think we have lost sight of that curiosity and drive we find in being a programmer. our goal is to *just* start somewhere and create something new, and maybe even find a path back to that place of growth through passion again in what we do.</sub></sub>
