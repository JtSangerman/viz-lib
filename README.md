# viz-lib
Lightweight library of visual and harmonic renderings aimed to please the eye and stimulate the mind (via d3.js). Seamlessly improve the aesthetic to any of your web apps using viz-lib.
<sub><sub><sub>currently only developing support for Angular with global web support in future (surely)</sub></sub></sub>

This repo contains library source code and a simple angular web app for demo and documentation of library components available:
* Demo app source located at `src/demo-app`
* Lib source located at `src/lib` 

## run demo:
1. clone repo
2. `cd viz-lib`
3. `npm i`
4. `ng serve`

---------------------------------

Marcus and I are using this project as an outlet for exploring our interest in using visuals and/or harmoics to create renderings to depict beauty within data sets, algorithms, natural processes, natural patterns... or something. dunno yet! 

<sub><sub>i think we have lost sight of that curiosity and drive we find in being a programmer. our goal is to *just* start somewhere and create something new, and maybe even find a path back to that place of growth through passion again in what we do.</sub></sub>
